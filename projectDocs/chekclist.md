## 🎯 Implementation Priorities

1. **🔊 COMPLETE AUDIO** - Without music and sounds, the experience remains incomplete
2. **🎭 EVENT SYSTEM** - For narrative progression and reactive world
3. **⚔️ TYPES & STATUS** - Strategic combat depth
4. **🗺️ CONNECTED WORLD** - Overworld + 6-8 themed dungeons
5. **📈 EXTENDED PROGRESSION** - More spells, equipment, and customization

---

## 📊 Progress Metrics

### By Category
- **Technical Foundation:** 90% ✅
- **Basic Systems:** 70% ✅
- **Audio:** 0% ❌
- **Events/Scripting:** 10% ❌
- **Polish:** 20% ❌

### Recommendations
- **Short term:** Adding audio (even basic) will transform the experience
- **Medium term:** Event system for a living world + enrich combat with types/status
- **Long term:** Polish with mini-games and post-game content

### Next Steps to Reach 65%
1. Implement basic audio system
2. Add global flag system
3. Create NPC state management
4. Implement elemental types in combat

- Well-implemented fundamental systems
- Modular architecture allowing for extension
- Authentic Game Boy aesthetic

### Technical Debt
